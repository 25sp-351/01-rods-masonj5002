# Overview

You are to write a C program to solve the "Rod Cutting" problem.  This is about you writing C, so *please* do not google/gpt the code/algorithm. *(C issues, syntax -- sure, G/G them or reach out)*

# Input

1. The command-line argument after the program name will be a "supplied rod length" (that which you are going to cut). (example: `45`)

2. Read the list of piece prices from standard input. Each line has the format `<length>, <value>` where both are integers. (Example: `32, 10`) Read until an end-of-file.

# Rules

* There will be at least one value line.

* There is no guarantee that piece lengths are small enough to fit the supplied rod.

# Output

* Write the cutting lists and remainder to standard out. The format for each line is `<n> @ <size> = <total value>` (example: `5 @ 3 = 24`).

* After the cutting list, output the remainder: `Remainder: <length>` (example: `Remainder: 14`).

* After the remainder, output the final line which reports the total value of all the cuts: `Value: <total value>` (example: `Value: 137`)

# Grading

50 points - My standard rubric applies

# Turning it in

Accept this invitation https://classroom.github.com/a/ZOJ6noDG and commit your code there.

# Notes

* Read my "prep work" post and Canvas Resource

* Read my **C Style Guide** *(hint: grade is dependent on this)*

* If you have a question, asking sooner is better than later. I'm not always available Sunday.

* Don't forget -- I *may* hire you. This is a take-home project from Rex-i-Corp who is hiring A-level employees. Show that you are one of them. That **should** mean that you see where I didn't mention "standard stuff" and you should fill it in. *(will be more explicit in class Tuesday)*
